This suggests a need to develop self-sufficiency and deeper understanding of the code she writes.\nAttitude/Professionalism: Her attitude in the office is kind of ok; improve herself. This is vague but points to a need for more positive or proactive office conduct.\nDiscipline & Engagement:\nProject Management: She needs to stick to the project timeline.\nTeam Participation: She needs to participate in the team activities.\n\nOverall Assessment\nThis employee is a good communicator and team player, but her performance is being held back by a weak technical foundation and potentially lapses in professional attitude and discipline (timeline adherence, team participation).\nThe development plan should heavily focus on technical self-reliance (reducing reliance on AI) and project execution.",
